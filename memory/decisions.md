3. Add what was built
4. Add decisions made
5. Add API/contracts/schema changes
6. Add env/config added or changed
7. Add next recommended issue

# Decisions
- Use Node.js and Express for backend due to familiarity and ecosystem support
- Use React for frontend to leverage component-based architecture
- Choose PostgreSQL for its reliability and feature set
- Use Redis and BullMQ for efficient caching and queue management
- Docker Compose for consistent local development environment
\n## [2026-05-26T09:11:24Z] THU-28 Decisions\n- Store tool_calls and approvals as JSONB on skill_runs for fast retrieval.\n- Output stored as SHA-256 hash only to avoid heavy payloads; raw output remains external.\n- Usage charges recorded per run, linked to active credit pool when present; pools accumulate consumed/overage.\n- Minimal cohesive API surface for create/update/audit/charge to keep module boundaries clear.\n
\n## [2026-05-26T10:24:46Z] THU-30 Decisions\n- Store scan history in security_scans and latest summary on skills.\n- Activation blocked when quarantined, unreviewed, or unpinned; scripted skills require sandbox unless trusted.\n- Kept checks server-side for consistent enforcement across UIs.\n
\n## [2026-05-26T10:38:20Z] THU-31 Decisions\n- Kept UI minimal (table-based) and leveraged existing backend endpoints to reduce complexity.\n- Route protection is client-side token only; follow-up to integrate real auth.\n- Approvals list consumes /api/approvals if available; surfaces errors cleanly if endpoint is absent.\n
\n## [2026-05-26T10:46:57Z] THU-32 Decisions\n- Keep aggregation in SQL for performance and exportability.\n- Governance signals read from audit_logs events to avoid tight coupling to approval tables.\n- Cross-sell insights based on overlay_suites + active workspace assignments.\n
\n## [2026-05-26T10:54:11Z] THU-33 Decisions\n- Implemented seeding as an idempotent migration to keep environments consistent.\n- Used ON CONFLICT/WHERE NOT EXISTS guards to allow re-runs safely.\n- Minimal demo run+usage seeded to light up reporting/ledgers without heavy data volume.\n
\n## [2026-05-26T11:06:18Z] THU-34 Decisions\n- Avoided DB-coupled tests; used mocked pool to keep unit/integration portable.\n- Introduced app.js to enable route-level testing without a server.\n- Deferred real auth, escalation workers, and charting to DEFERRED_ITEMS.md.\n

## [2026-05-28] Gap-Assessment Decisions
- Use handbook-aligned status tiers (`Implemented`, `Partial`, `Missing`) for roadmap communication.
- Treat current codebase as a control-plane foundation, not a finished enterprise platform.
- Prioritize next milestones in order: auth/RBAC, approvals workflow, workers/runtime, integrations, then knowledge/search depth.
